# 🚀 START HERE - Fixed and Ready to Train!

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

I've fixed **3 critical bugs** that were preventing training:

1. ✅ **CUDA index error** - Vocab size mismatch (32k → 50k)
2. ✅ **OpenCoder config missing** - Added 'educational_instruct' config
3. ✅ **Memory overflow** - Limited BookCorpus to 50k samples

**👉 Read BUGFIXES.md for detailed explanation**

## 🎯 Quick Start (Just 2 Steps!)

### Step 1: Run Training

```powershell
python train.py
```

That's it! Training will:
- Load 50,000 BookCorpus samples (cached after first run)
- Load OpenCoder educational instruction dataset
- Train for ~4-8 hours
- Save checkpoints automatically

### Step 2: Use the Chatbot

After training completes:

```powershell
python chatbot.py
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Monitor Training
Watch the terminal output:
- Loss should decrease
- Perplexity should decrease
- No CUDA errors

### 2. Check GPU Usage
```powershell
nvidia-smi
```
Should show GPU memory being used (~10-16 GB)

### 3. If Out of Memory
Edit `config.py`:
```python
'batch_size': 4,  # Reduce from 8
```

### 4. Want More Data?
Edit `data_processing.py` line 44:
```python
max_samples = 100000  # Instead of 50000
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| CUDA OOM | Reduce batch_size to 4 or 2 |
| Dataset error | Delete `cache/` folder and retry |
| Slow training | Verify GPU is being used |
| Import errors | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

   - pretrain_best.pt
   - finetune_best.pt

2. **Metrics** in `training_stats/`
   - training_metrics.json
   - training_plots.png (after visualization)

3. **Final Model** in `training_outputs/`
   - llm_200m_final.pt

4. **Working Chatbot**
   - Interactive CLI
   - Multiple generation modes
   - Adjustable parameters
