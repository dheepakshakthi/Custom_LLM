## 🔍 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why 200M parameters?
- Large enough for good reasoning
- Small enough to train on single GPU
- 2.5× larger than SmolLM for better performance

### 2. Why unified training?
- Single task = simpler workflow
- Continuous learning from pre-train to fine-tune
- Better knowledge transfer

### 3. Why these hyperparameters?
- Pre-training: Higher LR (3e-4) for faster learning
- Fine-tuning: Lower LR (1e-4) to preserve pre-trained knowledge
- Weight decay & dropout: Prevent overfitting
- Gradient clipping: Prevent instability
- Early stopping: Automatic best model selection

### 4. Why RoPE + SwiGLU?
- RoPE: Better position encoding, enables length extrapolation
- SwiGLU: Empirically better than GELU in large models

### 5. Why Flash Attention?
- 2-4× faster training
- Reduced memory usage
- Exact attention (not approximate)

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Training
1. Use GPU (CPU is too slow)
2. Monitor GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`
3. Training will auto-save, safe to interrupt
4. Check `training_stats/` for progress
5. Reduce batch size if OOM errors occur

### For Chatbot
1. Higher temperature (0.9-1.2) = more creative
2. Lower temperature (0.5-0.7) = more focused
3. Adjust `repetition_penalty` if output is repetitive
4. Use `clear` command to reset context
5. Try different checkpoints for different behaviors

### For Best Results
1. Let training complete fully
2. Use fine-tuned checkpoint for chat
3. Experiment with generation parameters
4. Provide clear, specific prompts
5. Keep conversations focused
